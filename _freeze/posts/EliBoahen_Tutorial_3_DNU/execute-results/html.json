How to read in data, ___, ___, and _____\n\nFirst, let's kick off with the glossary from tutorial 2. I've edited the origial descriptions & added some of my own.\n\n## Helpful Commands\nTutorial 1: R Basics and Assigning Variables\n\n- Math: `+`,`-`,`*`,`/`\n- Booleans & Logical Operators: `==`,`>`,`<`,`>=`,`>=`\n- Assigning variables: `variable_name <- \"value\"`\n- Create vector ( the `R` version of lists ): `c()`\n\nTutorial 2: Reading and Describing Data\n\n- Preview data: `head()`\n- Get dimensions: `dim()`\n- Get column names and numbers: `colnames()`\n- Select specific columns: `select()`\n- `starts_with()`\n- `ends_with()`\n- `contains()`\n- Get values of column: `table()`\n- Get proportions of values of column: `prop.table()`\n- Tidy data: `gather()` and spread()`\n\nTutorial 3\n- `pivot_longer()`\n- `pivot_wider()`\n\n## What is Data?\nDataframes, or `df`, are 2-dimensional data structures--so tables\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(2,3,4,5)\nmean(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3.5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's introduce the 3 data-horsemen of our Tutorial 3:\n`pseo`, `electricity`, `anes`\n---------------------------------------------\n## Rendering your post\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. \n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nBe sure that you have moved your `*.qmd` file into the `posts` folder **BEFORE** you render it, so that all files are stored in the correct location.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nOnly render a single file - don't try to render the whole website!\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Pilot Student Blogs\n\nWe are piloting a workflow including individual student websites with direted and limited pull requests back to course blogs. Please let us know if you would like to participate.\n:::\n\n## Reading in data files\n\nThe easiest data source to use - at least initially - is to choose something easily accessible, either from our `_data` folder provided, or from an online source that is publicly available.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Using Other Data\nIf you would like to use a source that you have access to and it is small enough and you don't mind making it public, you can copy it into the `_data` file and include in your *commit* and *pull request*.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Using Private Data\n\nIf you would like to use a proprietary source of data, that should be possible using the same process outlined above. There may initially be a few issues. We hope to have this feature working smoothly soon!\n:::",
