Thank you for all the support I received.\n\n# Project Overview\nThis summer I release a survey exploring the current sentiments towards robots and cyborgs. Cyborgs and human like robots---or robot like humans---has been seen as a more Science Fiction idea and topic, however, I feel that with the increased eyes on A.I. and future-tech, these concepts are becoming more mainstream. This summer I also took an Internet Law and Policy course. I takeaway I had, was how US law tends to be reactive than proactive. This means laws tend to be made or drafted after an event or situation arises, not preemptively. I also noticed, that sentiments at the time of signing or creation play a huge role as to whether or not laws get passed, drafted, vetoed, or protested. The reactive nature of US law and the tech industry made me want to explore sentiments.\n\nSentiments can help us understand the populous opinion. This can tell us how individuals might vote, their concerns, their hopes, and their pain points. Through surveying, we can get a glimpse of the ways current opinions of robots and cyborgs, and forecast what policies might align with the populous. This is cyborg Anthropology.\n\n## What is Cyborg Anthropology?\nCyborg Anthropology goes back over a decade, exploring Human Computer Interaction but from the lens of culture, beliefs, languages, and more. Think of mobile phones becoming phone vs smart phone, becoming smartphone and dumbphone. We have language like \"a brick\" being used to describe phones from the 90's and early 2000's, \"a flip\" phone versus \"the flip\" phone, and \"indestructible\" is more associated with early models of mobile phones that our modern devices. Cyborg Anthropology is the exploration of Human-ness and Robot-ness, and how we discuss and understand it.\n\n## Data Overview\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncss_data <- read.csv(\"CSS_Responses_2023_admin.csv\")\n#head(css_data) <- I didn't get too much out of this\nview(css_data)\nsummary(css_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Timestamp         Email.Address \n Length:17          Mode:logical  \n Class :character   NA's:17       \n Mode  :character                 \n                                  \n                                  \n                                  \n I.agree.to.answer.each.question.honestly..based.on.my.own.thoughts..feelings..and.beliefs.\n Length:17                                                                                 \n Class :character                                                                          \n Mode  :character                                                                          \n                                                                                           \n                                                                                           \n                                                                                           \n I.understand.that.I.will.not.be.judged.for.my.responses..and.that.the.data.will.be.used.for.research.purposes.only.\n Length:17                                                                                                          \n Class :character                                                                                                   \n Mode  :character                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                                    \n I.understand.that.the.researcher.will.take.percussions.and.follow.measures.to.anonymize.the.data.and.responses.\n Length:17                                                                                                      \n Class :character                                                                                               \n Mode  :character                                                                                               \n                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                \n  I.am......

For this project, I will focus on Section 2 ( questions 13 to 31 ) and Section 4 ( questions 32 to 39 ), also the interesting results of `\"Are you a human?\"`.\nIn this data\n\n## Research Questions\n>\n- Currently, what does society believe to be the line between human and robot?\n- Currently, what does society believe to be the line between human and cyborg?\n- What is the overall sentiment towards robots?\n- What is the overall sentiment towards cyborgs?\n- When given cases that ask participants to apply their beleifs, do sentiments change?\n> \n \nI entered this project with 3 of these questions, and gained the other 2 while writing the survey. I had a smooth 3 question goal but, in a larger research goal, I would love to explore what we believe is the line between robots, humans, and cyborgs. Many in the field of Cyborg Anthropology believe we are already cyborgs. Though that may work in a research and conceptual model, the daily life of our current society does not reflect that sentiment---neither does US policy. The fact is, the *feelings* we have about technology, robots, and cyborgs weigh more than the reality and definitions we have laied. Ironically, those feeling guide the definitions we put into law.\n\n## Hypotheses\n- The majority of participants will have a positive association with humans.\n- The majority of participants will have a neutral association with cyborgs.\n- The majority of participants will have a negative association with robots.\n- 50% of participant sentiments will change after the survey. \n\n\n## Analysis\n\n\n\n\n### Sentiment Change\nThis question asks the participants if they're feelings have changed. It comes at the closing of the survey, after participants respond to 3 human-cyborg-robot related questions.\n\nIn which direction did said sentiments change? That is unknown. However, this data can tell us how sentiments towards robots or cyborgs can change *after* one faces the application of their morals. I wanted to explore this question, because it is itself an experiment, one can hold one sentiment, but apply another; it's a reflection of our current reactive model in policy and industry.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Taking column 41, \"Did your sentiments change\", turning it into a table, which gives us the frequency\nsentiment_changes <- table(css_data[,41])\nsentiment_changes\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nMinimally        No  Somewhat       Yes \n        6         2         6         3 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Then we turn it into a data frame\nsentiment_changes_df <- as.data.frame(sentiment_changes)\nnames(sentiment_changes_df)[1] <- \"Sentiment_Shift\"\nsentiment_changes_df\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Sentiment_Shift Freq\n1       Minimally    6\n2              No    2\n3        Somewhat    6\n4             Yes    3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Check your results\nsummary(sentiment_changes_df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Sentiment_Shift      Freq     \n Minimally:1      Min.   :2.00  \n No       :1      1st Qu.:2.75  \n Somewhat :1      Median :4.50  \n Yes      :1      Mean   :4.25  \n                  3rd Qu.:6.00  \n                  Max.   :6.00  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(sentiment_changes_df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Sentiment_Shift      Freq     \n Minimally:1      Min.   :2.00  \n No       :1      1st Qu.:2.75  \n Somewhat :1      Median :4.50  \n Yes      :1      Mean   :4.25  \n                  3rd Qu.:6.00  \n                  Max.   :6.00  \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Doing this manually\n#(sum(sentiment_changes_df$Freq))/sum(sentiment_changes_df$Freq)\n\na_change_in_sentiment <- ((6+6+3)/17)*100\nmin_some_change_in_sentiment <- ((6+6)/17)*100\nfull_change_in_sentiment <- ((3)/17)*100\nno_change_in_sentiment <- ((2)/17)*100\na_change_in_sentiment\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 88.23529\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmin_some_change_in_sentiment\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 70.58824\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfull_change_in_sentiment\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 17.64706\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nno_change_in_sentiment\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 11.76471\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see, the majority of participants had some change in their held sentiment at the start of the survey. 88.23% had some amount of change while 11.76% had a full change in sentiments\n\nThe majority participants had a minimal or slight shift in sentiment.

Hypotheses Revisted\nX for False\n✓ for True\n- [X] The majority of participants will have a positive association with humans.\n- [] The majority of participants will have a neutral association with cyborgs.\n- [] The majority of participants will have a negative association with robots.\n- [X] 50% of participant sentiments will change after the survey. \n\n#### The majority of participants will have a positive association with humans.\nThe response towards humans was generally neutral. based on the words used to describe humans, the response was quite neutral. I assumes many participants would answer more cynically, however the responses were quite scientific as well as conceptual---the concept of a human. \n\nI feel that a survey with direct questions about humans and humanness would be better suited for a hypothesis like this, however I think that gets more into morality and may distract from the overall survey.\n\n#### 50% of participant sentiments will change after the survey.\nThe data shows that 88.23% had a change in sentiment. My hypothesis was wrong; signifigaly more participants had a change that I predicted.\n\n# Conclusion\nInternet law started as a proactive step. Laws like Section 230 made the Internet what it is today, and it was done by collaborative efforts. Few could have foreseen the full realized potential of the internet, yet Chris Cox and Ron Wyden foresaw the Internet's impact on Free Speech. When proactive exploration and collaboration happens, we get the ability to react with guardrails versus attempting to wrangle as a situation spirals further.\n\nWith this survey, I hope to take the first step of many towards understanding human and non-human sentiment and culture to make societal and policy change.\n\nBest wishes, \nEli\n ",
