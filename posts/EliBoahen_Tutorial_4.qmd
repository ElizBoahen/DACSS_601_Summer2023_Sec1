From here on out, Tutorial Notes will be condensed

## What did you learn?
We learned about transforming data using `filter()`, `arrange()`, `slice()`, `rename()`, `recode()`, `mutate()`, `na_if()`, `replace_na()`, `case_when()` commands

## What did you remember?
`select` "pick something specifically" vs `filter`'s "remove this specifically" is really `select` rows, & `filter` columns.

## Anything you didn't understand?

## Something you would change?
I think it might be me, but I can't get the `pseo` data frame to work.
