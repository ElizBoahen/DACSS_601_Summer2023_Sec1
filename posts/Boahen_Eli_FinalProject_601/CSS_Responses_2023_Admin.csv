I feel we could live harmoniously if we could trust tech and the intentions behind what's being created would be considering the wellbeing of everyone including our planet but that's not the case since we must use tech in moderation and with great caution. including taking our time when things are being developed to make sure they are absolutely safe and secure before bringing them into society
I also feel things can get complicated when we start talking about rights lol
