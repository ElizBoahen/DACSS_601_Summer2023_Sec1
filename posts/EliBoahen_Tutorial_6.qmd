## What did you learn?
How to make my data pretty :D

## What did you remember?
`geom_violin` did not do what I thought it was gonna do. And honestly, visualizations in R are not as hard as I thought they were.

## Anything you didn't understand?
I still don't get why `pseo` doesn't work for me and is not listed in `R`
```{r}
data
```

## Something you would change?
I've been loving the glossary. I like this question at the end of each tutorial.


Best wishes,
Eli
